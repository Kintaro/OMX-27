- S1/S2 - Active step mode
    This would add an additional view in which steps can be turned on or off. 
    Steps that are off get ignored as if they did not exist. 
    Allows for fun performance manipulation of sequence without changing it. 

- S1/S2 pattern gate feature

- Arpegiator

- Chord Split Mode

- Add MidiFX to Seq, Chord, and Grids Modes

- Chord LED feedback

- Auto strum

- Earthsea sequencer, add into midi and chord modes, simple records what you play then plays back in natural time or quantized. 

- Pot CC Presets
    These would be templates for quickly setting cc's to work with a specific synth like a mm2 or digitone. 

    Might be easier to just have multiple banks of pot presets. 

    A key shortcut for changing banks would be nice.
