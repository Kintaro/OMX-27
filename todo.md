# To-Do 

* pattern saving

* Conditional triggers (see grid step on norns )

* Additional mode for MIDI settings (channel, etc)?

* clock divide/mulitply?

* what happens on CV when you have multiple keys pressed?

* UI

* Step recording

* copy note to other steps - or assign same note to all steps?


# BUGS

* missing note off if octave is changed while holding note on

* S2 - edit the rotation or length of a pattern with the encoder it freezes, and while the menu displays the settings, turning the encoder adjusts the tempo.


# IDEAS / FEATURE REQUESTS / WISH LIST

* chain patterns?

* extend pattern length - needs "pages" (1-8 bar drum patterns)

* knob banks (pots)?

* step probability

* while ??


# already done?

* add octave to note select
* note length?
