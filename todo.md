# To-Do 

* Pattern saving

* Step recording (needs testing)
 
* transpose entire sequence (needs testing)

* Additional mode for MIDI settings (channel, etc)?

* Change MIDI channel per pattern  

* Clock divide/mulitply?

* UI

* Copy note to other steps - or assign same note to all steps?

* Panic/all-notes-off on AUX?

* Conditional triggers (see grid step on norns )

* what happens on CV when you have multiple keys pressed?


# BUGS

* missing note off if octave is changed while holding note on


# IDEAS / FEATURE REQUESTS / WISH LIST

* chain patterns?

* extend pattern length - needs "pages" (1-8 bar drum patterns)

* knob banks (pots)?

* step probability

* randomize function

* quantization for the live playing.

* while ??


# already done?

* add octave to note select
* note length?
