# OMX-27 Documentation

## Concepts

Sequencer has 8 patterns (tracks).


Pots are mapped by default to CCs 21, 22, 23, 24 and 7 (volume). These can be changed in the firmware. Hopefully this will be configurable from a web-MIDI interface in future.


## Layout

Top left key = AUX  

In sequencer modes:

AUX key is transport start/stop.

"Black keys" (sharp/flat keyboard keys)  

The first 2 black keys are "Function Keys" 
- Function One will reset all sequences to step one. 
- Function Two: Press and hold and then press any pattern key to Mute that pattern

The next 8 select the active sequence pattern.

Hold a key (long press) to access parameters for that pattern.

"White keys" (bottom row)

These are your sequencer step on/off keys. Hold a key (long press) to access parameters for that step.
